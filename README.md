# Task 4: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization on Twitter Data


## Overview

In this task, we perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. We use a dataset from Kaggle, which contains tweets along with sentiment labels indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this task is the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset," which can be found on Kaggle. The dataset includes the following columns:

Tweet ID: Unique identifier for each tweet

entity: The entity mentioned in the tweet

sentiment: The sentiment of the tweet (Positive, Negative, or Neutral)

Tweet content: The content of the tweet


# Steps Involved


## Data Loading and Exploration

Loaded the Twitter sentiment dataset.
Displayed the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.


## Data Preprocessing

Cleaned the tweet content by removing URLs, special characters, and performing tokenization.
Converted the text to lowercase and removed stopwords for better analysis.


## Sentiment Distribution Visualization

Visualized the distribution of sentiments in the dataset using a bar plot.
Word Cloud Visualization

Created word clouds to visualize the most common words used in positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
Most Common Words Visualization

Visualized the most common words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets using horizontal bar plots.


## Files Included

## Results
The analysis provided insights into the distribution of sentiments and the most common words used in tweets for each sentiment category. The word clouds and bar plots helped in visualizing the patterns and trends in the data.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrated how to perform sentiment analysis on social media data and visualize the results using various NLP techniques. The visualizations provided a clear understanding of public opinion towards different entities mentioned in the tweets.
